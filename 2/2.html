                One of the most effective ways to tackle the problem of MYP 3 students' reluctance to seek counseling is by leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI). In particular, the integration of AI-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) in communication platforms can play a key role in improving the interaction between students and counselors. But how does this help?

By using NLP, the system can automatically evaluate the language used by students during their communication with the school. The AI analyzes various aspects of their message, such as the tone, choice of words, and emotional intensity. Based on these factors, it determines the severity of the problem and recommends whether a peer counselor or a professional school counselor should handle the issue.

This AI-based assessment allows students to receive targeted support without feeling overwhelmed or judged. For instance, minor issues that could be solved by peer counselors will be routed to them, while more serious concerns will be directed to professional counselors. This ensures that the student gets the right level of assistance without any unnecessary steps.

Furthermore, by enabling anonymous communication, the website adds another layer of protection for the studentâ€™s privacy. Knowing that their concerns are being addressed by the right person, without compromising their identity, can make students feel more comfortable and open to seeking support when needed.

Ultimately, the integration of AI and anonymity in this platform will create an environment where students feel safe to seek help, leading to better emotional and academic outcomes.
