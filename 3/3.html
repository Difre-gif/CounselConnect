                In schools today, it is crucial to provide students with the support they need in a way that feels accessible and non-intrusive. This is especially important for MYP 3 students, who may be going through personal or academic struggles but hesitate to seek help. One solution to this issue is the development of a website that facilitates anonymous communication between students and counselors.

The anonymity provided by this platform is vital. Many students are hesitant to reach out due to concerns over confidentiality. By creating an anonymous communication channel, students are empowered to share their concerns without the fear of being judged or exposed. This encourages more students to seek help early, preventing issues from escalating.

In addition to anonymity, the website incorporates Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically using a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system. The AI helps in identifying the seriousness of the student's problem by analyzing their message content. The system can recommend whether the issue should be handled by a peer counselor or if it needs the attention of a professional school counselor. This ensures that students get personalized support based on their specific needs.

By using AI, the platform also alleviates the workload on school counselors by filtering less critical issues to peer counselors, allowing them to focus on more serious cases. Meanwhile, the students benefit from an efficient, confidential system that responds to their concerns promptly, whether big or small.

This innovative solution addresses the core problem of reluctance among MYP 3 students by making support systems more accessible and effective through anonymity, AI, and personalized support.
